Introduction/Business Problem:
Sacramento is a very diverse and growing city and benefits from its diversity with an abundance of restuarants. Businessman Bob wants to open a restaurant
in Sacramento but needs to decide what type of restaurant. He doesn't want to open a boba shop when Sacramento already has a lot of boba, or a Taco place
if there are too many other taco places to compete with. He wants to see first where he should open his restaurant, and in that location, what restaurants
are already there so he knows what type of place he should open. 

Data:
I will be using data from Foursquare to accomplish this
